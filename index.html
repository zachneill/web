        I was also a crew member at Dunkin' for parts of two years, starting in 2018. During quarantine,
        I was tasked with providing on-the-job training to new employees. I also learned how
        to calm down clients. Oftentimes, they just need someone who understands that they're
        having the worst day ever.
